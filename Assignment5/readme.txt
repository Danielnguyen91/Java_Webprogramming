In this Assignment, I used the DOM parser technique to parse my XML file. I chose to use DOM parse because I can store all 
entire xml document to memory and easily access the element of the xml node. I can also go back the xml files 
and add, or remove nodes. I can even change the contents of the xml file, so I think DOM parse is easy to use than SAX parse.
With DOM parse, I can get the content of the element and check the duplicate of room or time between course, and I also check
the time between course to find the conflicts between courses
